As a deliverable for APS490, it should capture evidence from the course with your 
supervisor as primary audience. However, as an artifact that students may use beyond the course 
(e.g., applying for jobs or graduate school), it should include evidence from other curricular, co-
curricular, or extra-curricular experiences. As such, the portfolio supports student claims of 
proficiency as an engineer and/or a designer working with engineers and is intended for a wide 
audience that will include their supervisor and may include prospective employers, collaborators, 
and research supervisors.  
Portfolios typically include visual documentation of design work and experiences accompanied 
by textual narrative or reflection describing what you have done, how you did it, and how who 
you are makes your work unique from the work of other engineering students. TELS survey 
feedback may be included in the portfolio to demonstrate competency and growth in teamwork 
skills.  
Students  are  encouraged  to  set  an  earlier  deadline  for  the  final  portfolio  so  that  it  is  ready  for 
upcoming applications or interviews.
